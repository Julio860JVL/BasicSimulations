# BasicSimulations
Wednesday, April 2, 2025 ---> Beginning...
I've been extremely busy working 60 to 70 hours weekly at my primary job and the rest of my weekly hours I've been spending it with my family. 

I am always thinking about tiny silly applications that I wonder if I can code in C# and my time is usually very limited. But I will try to spend some time into coding again like I used to a few years ago. I need to get a better understanding at GitHub and coding structure and that will be one of my goals in this project.

There wasn't AI before. This time it will be much easier because I will be using AI to help me understand easier and better but I must be extremely careful with AI because AI has already thrown me in the wrong direction. So I must make sure to let AI help me but I cannot let AI to lead me.
